# BigotBlocker

Bigot Blocker is a Chrome addon used to block undesirables on voat.co. It is in early development. At this stage, it only adds a block/unblock button beneath comments and posts. I am not a professional javascript developer and would love any help that people could offer. I would like to add an options page where it displays your block list. I was having trouble getting the options page to read the localStorage. Eventually I'd like to block subverses too, so they no longer appear in the top posts panel.

Contact me at https://voat.co/user/escape or escapevoat@gmail.com if you want to help out with this plugin. Thanks guys!
